## Sample 4: Scalable PHP-Driven Slideshow with Accessible Templating *(php)*

This dynamic slideshow structure leverages PHP arrays to automate slide generation while embedding accessibility and image performance best practices by default. It enables junior developers or non-technical collaborators to add or rearrange slides using a copy-paste array structure, without wading into layout logic or template code. The live example has slightly different features (evidence of it's versatility) but it utilizes the same base;

### Why it matters:
- Eliminates redundant markup and hardcoded content.
- Encourages consistent slide formatting and accessible interactions.
- Enables fast updates and scaling with minimal developer effort.
- Incorporates progressive enhancement and lazy loading.

### What it shows:
- Back-end logic that empowers non-dev collaborators to easily maintain the slideshow.
- Best practices in accessibility: semantic HTML, aria-*, and role attributes.
- Thoughtful, maintainable templating that balances flexibility with performance.
- Developer-friendly commentary—annotated for easy understanding and scaling.


### Excerpt:
```php
<?php
	# Hey there, Captain Syntax! If you're adding, removing, or reordering slides — just remember:
	# - Each slide is wrapped in [square brackets]
	# - Each item inside needs "quotes" and a comma at the end (except the last one)
	# - The whole $slides array ends with a mighty semicolon
	# Your mission: keep the structure intact and the slideshow will obey!
	# Slide responsibly [=
?>
<?php
$slides = [
	[
		"topic" => "Topic1", 
		"info" => "...", 
		"href" => "..."
	],
	[
		"topic" => "Topic2", 
		"info" => "...", 
		"href" => "..."
	],
	[
		"topic" => "Topic3", 
		"info" => "...", 
		"href" => "..."
	]
];
?>

<div class="cycle-slideshow"
  data-cycle-fx="scrollHorz"
  data-cycle-timeout="0"
  data-cycle-pager=".spot02pager"
  data-cycle-pager-template='<button class="spotbtn spotbtn__pager" role="tab" type="button" aria-controls="service{{slideNum}}" aria-label="information about our {{topic}}"><h3 class="topic">{{topic}}</h3></button>'
  data-cycle-slides="> div"
  data-cycle-log=false
  >

<?php foreach ($slides as $index => $slide): 
	  $num = $index + 1;
	  $imgPath = "/assets/images/spotlight/spot02dec0{$num}.jpg";
?>
  <div id="service<?= $num ?>" class="slide<?= $num ?>" data-topic="<?= $slide['topic'] ?>" role="tabpanel">
	<img class="decoration" src="<?= $imgPath ?>" alt="" width="939" height="751" loading="lazy" decoding="async">
	<div class="info">
		<h2 class="topic"><?= $slide['topic'] ?></h2>
		<div class="info__mod"><?= $slide['info'] ?></div>
		<a class="spotbtn spotbtn__info" href="<?= $slide['href'] ?>">Keep Exploring<span class="screenreader"> information about <?= $slide['topic'] ?></span></a>
	</div>
  </div>
<?php endforeach; ?>
</div>

<div class="mod mod--pager spot02pager" role="tablist" aria-label="Service Navigation Tabs"><!-- EMPTY ELEMENT FOR DYNAMICALLY GENERATED PAGER ITEMS --></div>
```

## Personal note:
One of the challenges with slideshows—even when they’re well-structured—is the potential for things to get spaghetti quick. Between the ARIA attributes, interactive hooks, and nested classes, the markup can easily become overwhelming—especially for junior devs or non-coders who might need to edit it. The goal here was to create a readable, manageable abstraction that lets anyone add, remove, or reorder slides without diving into the technical weeds—or worrying about the order of things.
