# portfolio-code-samples
A curated selection of real-world code samples demonstrating my approach to accessible, high-performance, and creatively engineered front-end development.

This repo contains code samples and interface logic used across various sites Iâ€™ve developed. Each folder or file includes a brief explanation and live example links where applicable.

Each snippet represents a working solution from live projects, emphasizing clarity, modularity, and maintainability across HTML, CSS (LESS), JavaScript, and PHP templates.
