# portfolio-code-samples
A curated selection of real-world code samples demonstrating my approach to accessible, fast-loading, and creatively engineered front-end development.

This repo contains code samples and interface logic used across various sites I’ve developed. Each folder or file includes a brief explanation and live example links where applicable.

Each snippet represents a working solution from live projects, emphasizing clarity, modularity, and maintainability across HTML, CSS (LESS), JavaScript, and PHP templates.

**Sample 3**  
🎩 **Smart Asset Loader (PHP)**  
Conditional script/style loading for rarely used pages—keeping things lean where possible, and only loading what’s needed, when it’s needed. A subtle backend enhancement that boosts performance sitewide.

**Sample 4**  
♿ **Scalable Slideshow with Accessible Templating (PHP)**  
A templated PHP slideshow structure that’s fully accessible, maintainable, and friendly to non-dev editors. Handles ARIA attributes, dynamic tab/tabpanel relationships, and lazy-loaded assets.

**Sample 5**  
📽️ **Responsive Video Publisher (LESS / CSS Architecture)**  
A flexible video container system that uses just four inputs to automate aspect-ratio handling, breakpoint logic, and CLS-friendly layout scaling. Smart, reusable, and adaptable to any custom design.

What you’ll find here isn’t a comprehensive showcase of everything I can do—rather, it’s a curated set of examples that reflect how I think. Some of it might not be flashy or complex (and frankly, if the code is calling attention to itself, something’s likely gone wrong). The real value? The absence of surprise. Predictability, in this context, is a feature, not a flaw.

Like a box of chocolates—sure, there’s the familiar milk chocolate, the bold dark, even that weird one with the toothpaste filling 😆—and maybe a few you’ve never tasted. Each piece is deliberate.

My hope is that these examples show how I start by asking the right questions, focus on solving the right problems, and build solutions that optimize for clarity, usability, and impact.

Thanks for reading.
