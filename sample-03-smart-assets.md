## Sample 3: Smart Asset Loading *(PHP)*  
### Conditional script/style loading for rare-use pages

Prevents unnecessary scripts and styles from loading on most pages by conditionally including them only where needed. Reduces bloat, improves performance, and adheres to best practices in modularity.

### Sorry, No flashy demo here—
this magic happens behind the curtain *(code nerds, this one's just for us)*.

### Why it matters:
- Avoids unnecessary asset loading for pages that don’t need them.
- Streamlines performance across all builds by reducing script bloat.
- Offers scalable logic for adding future conditional assets.
- Employs defensive coding: functions only execute when explicitly needed.

### What it shows:
- Creative and efficient resource gating.
- Clean conditional logic in PHP.
- Awareness of asset impact on page performance.
- Use of a defensive, "Miyagi-Do" delivery method—only strikes when necessary.

### Excerpt from helper file:
```php
if (!function_exists('load_abc')) {
	function load_abc($type, $vendor) {
	  $valid_paths = ['/pagename1', '/pagename2', '/pagename3'];
	  foreach ($valid_paths as $path) {
		if (strpos($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], $path) !== false) {
		  if ($type === 'styles') {
			echo '<link rel="stylesheet" href="' . $vendor . 'ABC/abc.min.css">';
		  } elseif ($type === 'script') {
			echo '<script src="' . $vendor . 'ABC/abc.min.js"></script>';
		  }
		  return;
		}
	  }
	}
}

if (!function_exists('load_xyz')) {
	function load_xyz($vendor) {
	  if (strpos($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], "/pagename") !== false) {
		echo '<link rel="stylesheet" href="' . $vendor . 'XYZ/xyz.min.css">';
	  }
	}
}
```

### Excerpt from layout:
```php
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="<?php echo $vendor . $global_css; ?>">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/local.css">
  <?php load_abc('styles', $vendor); ?>
  <?php load_xyz($vendor); ?>
</head>
<body>
  ...
  <script src="<?php echo $vendor . $global_js; ?>"></script>
  <script defer src="/js/local.js"></script>
  <?php load_abc('script', $vendor); ?>
</body>
```

## Personal note:
Not every win is flashy—but performance-minded patterns like this make a big difference.

This was one of those low-grade headaches I was glad to finally fix: globally managed scripts and heavy styles were being loaded on every single page—despite only being needed on two rarely used ones. The excess overhead hurt page speed and rippled out to impact performance and even search visibility. The solution? Simple plugin logic that limits asset loading to when it’s actually needed. It wasn’t flashy, but it made all the difference—and I was surprised no one had tackled it before.
